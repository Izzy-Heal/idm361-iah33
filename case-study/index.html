      Izzy Heal Idm 361 Final Project Case Study
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      The goal for this project was to create a web based application that could function offlince once downloaded onto an ios device. There was also a focus on visual optimization
      for small mobile screens. (cell phones) I created an app to be used in place of dice tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Context and Challenge
    </h2>
    <p>
        When playing a tabletop roleplaying game you use a collection of differently sided dice. The aim for my application wa both to learn the concepts
        needed to create a mobile web application, and to streamline the tabletop rollplaying game experience by collecting all of the necessary dice into one simple
        application.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The Process and Insight
    </h2>
    <p>
        The initial wireframe for my idea can be seen <a href = "https://izzyheal.com/idm361/hwk02/wireframe.html" target="_blank">here.</a>    
        From there I built out the first pass at the <a href = "https://izzyheal.com/idm361/hwk03" target="_blank">application.</a> It is quite buggy and the random number does not yet work
        but this would be fixed whithin the coming weeks. The next <a href = "https://izzyheal.com/idm361/hwk04" target="_blank">version</a> has custom dice icons that I created and switching between 
        those icons works when clicking on each button. The <a href = "https://izzyheal.com/idm361/beta" target="_blank">beta</a> version of the project has the number generation but all of the other graphics are the same.
        
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Solution
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <a href = "https://izzyheal.com/idm361/final" target="_blank">final</a> version of the project has more customized style to refect the common Dungeons and Dragons setting
        the dice also shake when you hit the button for each one, and local storage has been implemented. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        The Results
    </h2>
    <p class="end">
        I believe my project is successful as I learned a lot about the process of creating a web application. I enjoyed the process of creating the final project and look forward 
        to building upon this knowledge in future classes.
